\# Week 2 – Red Teaming Practicals



This week covers \*\*full-spectrum Red Team operations\*\*, from reconnaissance to exploitation, lateral movement, post-exploitation, and reporting. All practicals are organized into subfolders for easy access.

\## Key Learnings

\- \*\*Reconnaissance:\*\* Passive methods reduce detection risk.  

\- \*\*Phishing \& Social Engineering:\*\* Humans are the weakest security link.  

\- \*\*Exploitation \& Lateral Movement:\*\* Credential hygiene and monitoring are crucial.  

\- \*\*Post-Exploitation:\*\* Covert channels highlight the importance of network monitoring.  

\- \*\*Reporting:\*\* Professional documentation communicates findings clearly to stakeholders.
